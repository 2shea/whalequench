So you've decided to try using speech recognition to write code. You've installed all the things and it's time to start talking to your computer, but where to start?? Learning a new keyboard layout can be daunting, so an even more extreme change to using speech can be very intimidating, or even seem impossible. If you are looking to use voice and feeling like "OMG HOW DO I EVEN", I've compiled some strategies some learning strategies and tips to help you get started.

_This post assumes that you already have a working voice set up and that you are using [Talon](https://talonvoice.com/) and Dragon Dictation. If you need help with the set up, check out the [Talon docs](https://talonvoice.com/docs/index.html#document-index), join the [Talon Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/talonvoice/shared_invite/enQtMjUzODA5NzQwNjYzLTY1NzZjNzM4NjVhZjZhYWFlNmZkYmU2YzE2ZjQxZjcyMTgwNDk5NDg2YzhmZDRmNmEwYThkODEyYjY4ZGZmODE), and check out this video on the basics made by a Talon user._

# Start With The Basics

* Spell some words using the alphabet
* Practice some numbers, symbols, and arrow keys
* Try some of your favorite keyboard shortcuts

### Letter Keys (aka The Alphabet)
Learning the alphabet for letter keys is a great place to start. It's a bite-size set of commands to learn, and they will be used all the time (spelling, keyboard shortcuts, vim, etc.) so it's important to be able to recall them quickly. Alphabet keys are represented by a set of words where each word is a command for a letter key. The alphabet can be customized, but I recommend using another voice coder's alphabet as a starting point. You can find one in the [Talon Community repository](https://github.com/dwiel/talon_community), or start with mine:

```
air bat cap dip each far gone harp sit jury crunch look mad near odd pit quench red sun trap urge vest whale plex yank zip
```

_Newbies to voice coding often ask why not use the NATO Phonetic Alphabet (Alpha, Bravo, ...)? Many of the NATO words are multiple syllables (e.g., November) and are not as efficient, which is important because the alphabet commands that will be used all the time._

Practice reciting the alphabet and spelling words. Spending some time upfront to get efficient recall will pay off. Most of the other voice commands are easy enough to learn as you go or reference when you need them, but the alphabet is essential.

### Numbers
Numbers should be easy: "one" for 1, "two" for 2, etc. For multiple digits, chain them, e.g "one two five" for 125.

### Symbols
Get comfortable with the commands for symbols. Most can be easily mapped to something easily remembered, e.g., "dollar" for $, "percent" for %. 

### Arrows
Arrow keys are important for basic navigation and keyboard shortcuts. They are used frequently enough that the commands should be simple, but bare "up", "down", etc. are likely to get accidentally triggered often. I recommend adding a prefix, for example "go up", "go down", "go left", etc. If you have the Talon Community repository, these will already be prefixed with "go".

### Modifiers
Most modifiers can be reference using their key name, e.g. "control" for Control, "command" for Command. Because "shift" can be difficult to say, many voice coders use "ship". Practice combining the modifier keys with the alphabet to use your favorite keyboard shortcuts. At this point, you can do almost anything a keyboard can do, but probably not as efficient just yet.

# Command Help
Voice coding is different than keyboard coding in that it requires learning a library of commands to be efficient. Typing everything out by individual key would be infuriatingly slow. Being able to quickly reference the set of available commands quickly and easily is important to maintain "the flow" of coding (we all know context switching is taxing). It isn't realistic to think that you will memorize all of the commands, especially if you are iterating on your commands all the time like i do, so having them handy is important.

I built some command help webviews which can be accessed using voice commands. I have mine set up with three help commands (what you say will appear on the left, output on the right):

### "help alphabet"
### "help context"
### "help \<context name>", e.g. "help sublime"





# Navigating Your Mac
# Words
# Custom Vocab
# Overrides
# Formatters
# Practice Copying Code
# Use Simple Tasks for Practice












Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
